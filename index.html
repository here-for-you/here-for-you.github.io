    <h1>Here for You</h1>
    <p>Here for You is a student organization at Carnegie Mellon University founded to address student issues regarding student mental health, with a focus on improving campus culture and improving access to support resources. We seek to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Support those who are currently facing mental health-related issues and empower them to seek professional help and other resources that both CMU and the Pittsburgh community offer.</li>
      <li>Advocate for those struggling with mental health issues by working to alleviate the stigma associated with mental illnesses and by becoming a liaison between students and the administration on mental health-related issues.</li>
      <li>Educate the general student body to better understand what mental health disorders are thereby increasing awareness, teach how to recognize symptoms in a peer or oneself, and what resources are available on campus and in Pittsburgh.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Founded in 2019, our membership is open to all undergraduate and graduate students at CMU.</p>
    <p>Our Spring 2023 meetings are on Mondays from 5PM to 6PM in PHA19D.</p>
